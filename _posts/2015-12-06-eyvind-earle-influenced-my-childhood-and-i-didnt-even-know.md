I recently discovered an artist by the name of Eyvind Earle. He worked for Disney as a Artist/ Illustrator in the '50s and his work had a profound influence on the films that I, as a kid, watched until the tapes began to deteriorate. 

Growing up in New England, I am particularly fond of this piece:
